        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a page where I send all my domains that don't have anything on them yet.<br/>
            That means you are looking at a super cool project that I might or might not actually do at some point.

        <h2>Who are you and what are you doing in my computer?</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jennifer Kirsch, although my friends call me Syd (long story).<br/>
            I am a web developer with way too many ideas syndrome (ADHD), which leads to me buying a lot of
            domains.<br/>
            If you want to look at things I actually did build, consider taking a look at
            <a href="https://dysphoric.dev">my blog</a> or
            <a href="https://github.com/DysphoricUnicorn">my GitHub account</a>.

        <h2>Is this domain for sale?</h2>
        <p>
            No.<br/>
            (Unless you're extremely rich. If I could buy a house and a whirlpool after selling it, I might consider
            that.)
