# dysphoricParkingPage

This is just a small page I threw together quickly to have something I can point my not-yet-used domains to.

Feel free to use it if you feel like it, but I doubt this will be too interesting.  
If you use it, maybe replace my name and links though.

There is a [demo page](https://parking.svc.dysphoric.space) that will always serve it.

I was meaning to use GitHub pages, but it doesn't allow one to use custom directory like `src/` as root, and I'm not sure it works
well with multiple domains attached.
